# React Guide

A skill that helps write idiomatic React components.

## When to use

Use this skill when creating new React components or refactoring existing ones.

## Guidelines

- Always use functional components with TypeScript
- Extract custom hooks for reusable logic
- Use `React.memo` only when profiling shows a performance issue
- Prefer composition over prop drilling — use context for deeply shared state
- Co-locate styles, tests, and stories with the component
